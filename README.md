# ChemistrySyntaxChecker
a simple syntax checker project done as an exercise for defensive programming.
This syntax checker does not match element names to the periodic table, but rather sets a criteria for valid chemical syntax.
A valid chemical element would range from 1 to 3 characters, first letter being upper-case and the rest being lower-case.
